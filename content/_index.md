Welcome! <br/>
I’m Timothee. This is my little, minimalistic [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) on the Internet — make yourself at home!

At the moment, I'm studying C/C++ at [[entries/42 Warsaw|42 Warsaw]] and planning to specialize in Cybersecurity, building on my solid background in development.
