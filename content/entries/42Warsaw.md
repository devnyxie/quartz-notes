# Why?

I've decided to apply for 42 after a few months of searching for a job with no success, even with many personal projects in my portfolio. Truth be told, I did not have any high hopes - I went in only for a chance of getting a good internship, that's all.

# Piscine

The first month was a blast. What about a month of speedrun through the base concepts of C? In short, it was like doing leetcode problems in C, every day for a month. I've learned a lot, and I've met a lot of great people. Finished that month with an 8 hour long exam, which was a bit stressful, but I've passed it with quite a good score, not to brag (66, highest was 72).

# Studies

After the piscine, I've started the actual studies. The projects are really interesting, and I've learned a lot from them - not only about programming, but also about working in a team, and about managing my time.
