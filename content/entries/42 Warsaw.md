# Why?

I've decided to apply for 42 after a few months of searching for a job with no success, even with many personal projects in my portfolio. Truth be told, I did not have any high hopes - I went in only for a chance of getting a good internship, that's all.

# Studies

The first few months of studying were a pleasant surprise. I learned so much about C, algorithms, Vim, advanced Linux concepts, and many other topics. I also met incredible people and had a lot of fun along the way. Perhaps most importantly, I discovered a lot about myself - I realized that Iâ€™m capable of achieving far more than I initially believed.
