# Backstory
I’m not entirely sure if I love minimalism, but I can’t live without it. I really like the websites packed with features and themes, cluttered desktop setups, a variety of gadgets in my backpack, and heavily decorated apartments filled with plants ~
After all, that's what life is about - vibrant colors and the little details that make everything feel alive.

Unfortunately, by nature I'm an extreme **neurotic**, which means I'm a very, very stressed person. As a bonus, I can't focus on anything if there a is mess around me.

If there is a mess in my room, there's also a mess in my brain. I can't concentrate, and my existing stress shoots through the roof. I crave order and minimalism, as it gives me the mental space to breathe, create and function.

*I’m not a fan of labels like [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), so let’s leave that out of the conversation. Everyone has their own challenges, and it’s important to learn how to overcome them rather than using them as excuses.*

That said, this tendency was much more noticeable during my childhood. I vividly remember being unable to walk past anything that wasn’t perfectly aligned. For instance, I’d re-position scissors in the bathroom because they weren’t placed at a perfect 90-degree angle. Thankfully, I’ve managed to overcome those quirks over time.

# Where am I going with this backstory?
It's essential to understand how our brain works in order to.. exist happily, you know? We are [here to stay](https://youtu.be/3qFEZIG31ZQ?si=82O452SpYnZJcrVJ). Our time is limited, and the faster we solve such issues, the better it is for us. For me it may be minimalism; for you, it might be something entirely different. As long as it makes us happy, that’s what truly matters.
