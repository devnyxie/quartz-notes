# Topic
Setting up a Kuma Uptime Page on our Raspberry Pi 4B, and configuring it to be accessible from the internet using the same Cloudflare Tunnel we've set up in the [[studies/unix/cloudflare_tunnel|previous part]].

# Docker Setup
First of all, we need to install Docker on our Raspberry Pi. The installation was quite straightforward, but keep in mind you should add your user to the `docker` group and preferably logout and login again to apply the changes.

# Kuma Uptime Page
Kuma is a simple, modern, and beautiful uptime monitor. It's open-source, and it's perfect for our needs. We can easily set it up using Docker, and it's also quite easy to configure.

## Installation
To be honest, it might be one of the most straightforward installations I've ever done. We just need to run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always -p 3001:3001 -v uptime-kuma:/app/data --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```

This command will pull the latest version of the `louislam/uptime-kuma` image from Docker Hub, and it will run it in a detached mode. We're also mapping the container's port `3001` to the raspi's port `3001`, and we're mounting a volume named `uptime-kuma` to the container's `/app/data` directory.

## Configuration

### Monitors

After running the command, we should be able to access our Kuma Uptime Page by visiting `http://localhost:3001` in our browser. The configuration is **very** simple, and is done through the web interface. Create an account, log in, and add your first monitor.

> [!info] What is a monitor?
> A monitor is a service that Kuma will check for uptime. You can add a monitor by providing a name, URL, and check interval. For example, you can add a monitor for `https://devnyxie.com` that will check every 5 minutes. If the URL is not reachable (HTTP status code is not from the 200 range), Kuma will notify you.

### Status Page

After you have added your first monitor, you should create a public Status Page. Choose a path, e.g., `status.devnyxie.com`, and customize the page by adding a logo, a title, and a description if you want.

Mine looks like this:

# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

Now that we have our Kuma Uptime Page running on our Raspberry Pi, we can configure our Cloudflare Tunnel to make it accessible from the internet. Since we've already set up the tunnel in the [[studies/unix/cloudflare_tunnel|previous part]], we just need to modify the `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` file and restart the `cloudflared` service. `:D`


Here is the configuration we've stopped on in the previous part:

```yaml title="config.yml"
tunnel: demo-tunnel
credentials-file: /home/devnyxie/.cloudflared/18006ba-5dc2-0000-8111-c625b010169.json
ingress:
  
  - hostname: demo.devnyxie.com
    service: http://localhost:8080

  - service: http_status:404
```

Fortunately, we can add as many ingress rules as we want. We can add a new rule for our Kuma Uptime Page:

```yaml title="config.yml" {8-9}
tunnel: demo-tunnel
credentials-file: /home/devnyxie/.cloudflared/18006ba-5dc2-0000-8111-c625b010169.json
ingress:
  
  - hostname: demo.devnyxie.com
    service: http://localhost:8080

  - hostname: status.devnyxie.com
    service: http://localhost:3001

  - service: http_status:404
```

After modifying the config file, we need to restart the `cloudflared` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

*Or, if the service is running in the foreground, you can just restart the tunnel by pressing `Ctrl+C` and running the `cloudflared tunnel run demo-tunnel` command again.*
