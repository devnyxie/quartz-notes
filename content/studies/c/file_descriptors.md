A File Descriptor (fd) is a unique integer assigned by the kernel to represent an open file, socket, or other resource. Each process gets its own file descriptor table, which is a per-process array of file descriptors. The first three file descriptors are reserved for **standard input** (0), **standard output** (1), and **standard error** (2). Any other number is a file descriptor.

An independent file descriptor table is created for each process when it is initialized. When a process is created, it inherits the file descriptor table from its parent process. The file descriptor table is always initialized with the standard file descriptors: [`0`, `1`, `2`].

When a process opens a file, the kernel assigns the lowest available file descriptor to the file. The file descriptor is then stored in the file descriptor table of the process that opened the file: [... `3`].

<!-- 1. **Process Calls `open()` or Equivalent**:
   - The process requests to open a file by calling a system call like `open()`.

2. **Kernel Interacts with the Inode Table**:
   - The kernel locates the file on the filesystem using its **path**.
   - It looks up the file's **inode** in the inode table to access the file's metadata (like permissions, type, and location on disk).
   - If the file doesnâ€™t exist and the process requested `O_CREAT`, the kernel creates a new inode for the file.

3. **Kernel Updates the System-wide File Table**:
   - The kernel creates a new **entry** in the system-wide file table.
   - This entry includes:
     - The **inode reference** for the file.
     - **File offset**, initially set to 0.
     - **Access mode** and **flags** (e.g., `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`).
   - If the file is already open by another process, the kernel might reuse the existing system-wide file table entry, depending on the use case.

4. **Kernel Updates the Process's File Descriptor Table**:
   - The kernel finds the **lowest available index** in the process's **file descriptor table**.
   - It creates a new entry in the process's table that points to the new (or existing) **system-wide file table entry**. -->

# System Calls

File descriptors are an essential concept in Unix-like operating systems and are used in system calls like:

- `open()`: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
- `read()`: Reads data from a file using a file descriptor.
- `write()`: Writes data to a file using a file descriptor.
- `close()`: Closes a file and releases the file descriptor.
