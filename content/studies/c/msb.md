The **Most Significant Bit (MSB)** is the leftmost bit in a binary number that represents the sign of the number. In a signed integer, the MSB is `1` for negative numbers and `0` for positive numbers.

For example, in an 8-bit signed integer:

- **Decimal 5** → `00000101` (MSB is `0`)
- **Decimal -5** → `11111011` (MSB is `1`, two's complement form)
