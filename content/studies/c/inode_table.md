# What is an Inode Table?

An inode (index node) table is a data structure in Unix-like file systems that stores key information about each file, except its name and data. Think of it as a database that the filesystem uses to keep track of file metadata and data block locations.

## Structure of an Inode

Each inode contains:
- File Metadata:
  - File type (regular file, directory, symbolic link, etc.)
  - File permissions (e.g., `rwxr-xr--`)
  - Owner and group IDs 
  - File size
  - Number of links
- Timestamps (access, modification, change)
- Location of the file's data blocks
- Other Attributes

## Key Concepts

- **Inode Number**: A unique identifier for each file
- **Directory Entry**: Maps filenames to inode numbers
- **Hard Links**: Multiple directory entries pointing to same inode
- **Soft Links**: Special files containing paths to other files
- **Block Pointers**: Track file data locations on disk

# Viewing Inode Information

You can easily check inode number using `ls -i` and view inode information with `stat` command:

```bash {2,5}
# List inode number
devnyxie:~$ ls -i filename.txt
  9862203 filename.txt
# Display inode information
devnyxie:~$ stat filename.txt
  File: filename.txt
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
  Device: 259,5	Inode: 9862203     Links: 1
  Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/devnyxie)   Gid: ( 1000/devnyxie)
  Access: 2025-01-19 18:04:10.816862088 +0100
  Modify: 2025-01-19 18:04:10.816862088 +0100
  Change: 2025-01-19 18:04:42.024653510 +0100
  Birth: 2025-01-19 18:04:10.816862088 +0100
```

# Inode in Action: How It Works

## Interaction with Files

The role of inodes becomes clear when you interact with files by name. Here’s what happens when you run `cat simple.txt`:

1. **Directory Lookup**:  
   The system checks the current directory (or path) to find an entry for `simple.txt`. This entry maps the filename to its corresponding inode number (e.g., `9860740`).
   
2. **Inode Retrieval**:  
   The system retrieves the inode structure from the inode table. This structure contains:
   - File type, permissions, owner/group, and timestamps.
   - Pointers to the data blocks where the file's content is stored.

3. **Data Access**:  
   Using the inode’s block pointers, the system locates the file’s data blocks on the disk and outputs the content to your terminal.

## Creating a file

When you create a file:
1. The system allocates an inode
2. Directory entry links filename to inode number
3. File metadata gets stored in the inode
4. Data block locations are recorded in the inode
