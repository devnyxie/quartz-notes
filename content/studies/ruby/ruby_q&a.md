# Key Features
- **Syntax**: Ruby's syntax has an appeasing natural language style. This, paired with its dynamic typing, powerful metaprogramming features, and absence of semicolons, results in clean and expressive code.
- **Gems**: Ruby's package manager, RubyGems, simplifies library management, making it easy to integrate numerous third-party extensions.
- **Database Integration**: ActiveRecord, a popular object-relational mapping system, aids in managing database records via a natural, object-oriented interface.
